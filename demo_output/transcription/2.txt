text:  Hi, welcome to Hot Chocolate Hits. Today we're combining two breakfasts, oatmeal and pancakes

start: 8.28
end: 14.84
text:  to create some moist, soft, fluffy, healthy, cinnamon-y pancakes. These are amazing and

start: 14.84
end: 18.88
text:  they taste great with fruit and they're perfect for Sunday breakfast. So let's get started.

start: 18.88
end: 23.32
text:  You want to start by adding half a cup of whole wheat flour to a bowl along with a third

start: 23.32
end: 27.88
text:  cup of quick cooking oats, I used the Quaker kind, and a tablespoon of brown sugar for

start: 27.88
end: 32.519999999999996
text:  some sweetness, you can use granulated sugar if you like. Next, add in a teaspoon of baking

start: 32.519999999999996
end: 36.92
text:  powder which makes these pancakes very fluffy and half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon for

start: 36.92
end: 42.08
text:  that warm flavor that goes so well with the oats. Blend those ingredients together nicely

start: 42.08
end: 46.66
text:  and then crack in one whole egg. You can also use two egg whites but I wanted to make do

start: 46.66
end: 50.84
text:  with the whole egg. You also want to add in half a teaspoon of vanilla extract for some

start: 50.84
end: 56.16
text:  flavor and two tablespoons of yogurt, you can use any kind you like, Greek yogurt, vanilla

start: 56.16
end: 60.8
text:  yogurt, just make sure you add it because it makes these pancakes very, very moist.

start: 60.8
end: 64.47999999999999
text:  Mix the ingredients together with a whisk or a spoon or a spatula, it's a very basic

start: 64.47999999999999
end: 68.36
text:  recipe so it doesn't really matter in what order you add the ingredients in. I like to

start: 68.36
end: 72.47999999999999
text:  start with dry ingredients so that I can get the baking powder evenly distributed throughout

start: 72.47999999999999
end: 77.47999999999999
text:  the batter. Now you want to add two thirds of a cup of milk, stir in the milk just until

start: 77.47999999999999
end: 81.36
text:  incorporated, you want to make sure you don't over mix the pancake batter because that'll

start: 81.36
end: 85.64
text:  result in a tough pancake. I have here a pan that I've greased with a little bit of oil

start: 85.64
end: 89.56
text:  and it's been heating for about five minutes. I'm just going to scoop mouthfuls of the batter

start: 89.56
end: 94.28
text:  using an ice cream scoop so that I get nice even pancakes and I just like to spread it

start: 94.28
end: 98.68
text:  out slightly just to make sure that it's a little bit flatter and more of a circle shape

start: 98.68
end: 104.0
text:  like pancakes are supposed to be. You essentially want about a quarter cup of pancake batter

start: 104.0
end: 108.6
text:  for each pancake. Cook these babies for about two to three minutes or until you see those

start: 108.6
end: 113.52
text:  bubbles pop up on the surface before flipping and then cook for another two to three minutes,

start: 113.52
end: 117.64
text:  make sure you're using medium heat. As you can see they're nice and thick and they're

start: 117.64
end: 123.32
text:  a beautiful golden brown color. Now all that's left is stacking them high on a plate and

start: 123.32
end: 128.4
text:  piling them with your favorite toppings. My personal preference, drenching them in some

start: 128.4
end: 133.8
text:  maple syrup. Oh just watch it dribble down the sides. That is what I call a stack of

start: 133.8
end: 138.35999999999999
text:  good pancakes. I also like to add some fresh berries, I'm using blueberries and some frozen

start: 138.35999999999999
end: 142.35999999999999
text:  raspberries because that was all that was available. Serve them also with some butter,

start: 142.36
end: 148.4
text:  that's the best, before digging in. These pancakes take no more than five to ten minutes

start: 148.4
end: 153.4
text:  to put together, they're really quick to make, they're really simple and they're so soft.

start: 153.4
end: 161.24
text:  Cinnamon and oats always go perfect together, especially when you're doing oatmeal. These

start: 161.24
end: 166.28000000000003
text:  taste amazing with fruits and of course you want to put on some maple syrup and some butter.
