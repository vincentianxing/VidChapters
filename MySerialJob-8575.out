text:   Today I'm making a BLT sandwich, which you know just regular bacon, lettuce and tomatoes

start:  20.32
end:  22.0
text:   get a twist when I'm making it.

start:  22.0
end:  26.2
text:   So I've just got a little bit of Olive Oil in the pan, and now I'm just kind of grilling

start:  26.2
end:  27.52
text:   these Tomatoes in this pan.

start:  27.52
end:  30.16
text:   I want to get the maximum flavour out of them.

start:  30.16
end:  35.08
text:   Usually you'll always use tomatoes raw just as is, but I just want to add that little

start:  35.08
end:  38.519999999999996
text:   added dimension of cooked, slightly charred tomatoes.

start:  38.519999999999996
end:  39.519999999999996
text:   Yum!

start:  49.519999999999996
end:  53.2
text:   Okay so the tomatoes are looking lovely and now I'm going to cook the bacon.

start:  53.2
end:  57.32
text:   You can do this in the oven, but you know I'm going to do this in the frying pan.

start:  57.32
end:  58.88
text:   It's just easier this way.

start:  58.88
end:  61.2
text:   I don't need to put on the oven right now.

start:  61.2
end:  66.2
text:   Okay so just spread the oil around and now it's time to fry up the bacon.

start:  68.2
end:  73.2
text:   I've got very little oil in the pan because, ahh, you want to hear that sizzle.

start:  73.2
end:  85.2
text:   If only you could smell this right now.

start:  86.2
end:  103.2
text:   So the ones that are nice and crisp, I'm just going to put it on this paper towel to drain.

start:  105.2
end:  107.2
text:   There's a lot of fat in that pan.

start:  107.2
end:  110.2
text:   But it's also flavour, fat is flavour.

start:  111.2
end:  114.2
text:   Now all we have to do is just put together this sandwich.

start:  114.2
end:  116.2
text:   We've got some mayo here.

start:  118.2
end:  121.2
text:   You don't need too much, I'm just going to spread this on the bread.

start:  121.2
end:  126.2
text:   And what I really like adding to it is just a dash of Worcester sauce.

start:  127.2
end:  131.2
text:   And no more, otherwise it's just going to overpower all the other flavours of the bacon specially.

start:  132.2
end:  134.2
text:   This way it just complements the flavour.

start:  134.2
end:  135.2
text:   Okay.

start:  136.2
end:  139.2
text:   So now spread this on the bread.

start:  139.2
end:  145.2
text:   And you know what makes all the difference when you're making a sandwich is the bread that you've got.

start:  145.2
end:  148.2
text:   Try to get the freshest possible bread.

start:  149.2
end:  155.2
text:   And you know I'm making it as is, if you like you can toast this bread, you can grill it.

start:  155.2
end:  157.2
text:   It's nice any which way.

start:  157.2
end:  159.2
text:   It's just such a classic sandwich.

start:  159.2
end:  162.2
text:   Now the first layer is of lettuce.

start:  162.2
end:  165.2
text:   I always like to leave the stalk out.

start:  171.2
end:  174.2
text:   Now put the tomatoes.

start:  175.2
end:  178.2
text:   And that's it, you know this is just as simple as that.

start:  178.2
end:  180.2
text:   There's not too much going on here.

start:  180.2
end:  183.2
text:   But just these few ingredients are going to give us so much flavour.

start:  183.2
end:  186.2
text:   And at this point just sprinkle on some salt.

start:  187.2
end:  190.2
text:   Now I'm going to put the bacon.

start:  195.2
end:  197.2
text:   This is a bit enough for me.

start:  201.2
end:  204.2
text:   And that is your BLT sandwich to go.
