text:  Pressure cooker pasta fagioli is what we're making today.

start: 7.0
end: 9.5
text:  Lots of people are scared of using a pressure cooker in the kitchen.

start: 9.5
end: 12.5
text:  It's a really handy tool to be able to cook things very quickly.

start: 12.5
end: 20.0
text:  What it does is it seals and by using pressure and steam it cooks things that would normally have to cook for a long period of time much faster.

start: 20.0
end: 23.0
text:  So there's a couple of important parts to the pressure cooker.

start: 23.0
end: 25.0
text:  The lid and the actual pot part.

start: 25.0
end: 29.0
text:  You can see on the pot there's flanges all the way around which lock everything together.

start: 29.0
end: 32.0
text:  As well as that there's also a locking pin.

start: 32.0
end: 36.0
text:  So once you put the lid on and lock it into place there's a pin that'll come up as it comes into pressure.

start: 36.0
end: 43.0
text:  Which is going to make sure that this stays nice and sealed and safe so you can't open it.

start: 43.0
end: 47.0
text:  So to start cooking my pasta fagioli I have some pancetta here.

start: 47.0
end: 50.0
text:  Pancetta is similar to bacon. It's not smoked though it's just cured.

start: 50.0
end: 52.0
text:  It's a salty bacon with no smoke flavour.

start: 52.0
end: 55.0
text:  So I'm going to put this in to start.

start: 55.0
end: 60.0
text:  What I want to do, you don't need oil in this. We want to render out some of the fat from our pancetta.

start: 60.0
end: 64.0
text:  So I just want to put this into a dry pan over kind of medium high heat.

start: 64.0
end: 68.0
text:  You just want to sweat this a little bit and saute it to get those fats to come out.

start: 68.0
end: 75.0
text:  Kind of crisp it up a little bit and get some of that delicious pancetta bacon flavour into the base of our pasta today.

start: 75.0
end: 77.0
text:  Some of the other things that we're going to put in.

start: 77.0
end: 80.0
text:  I have some carrots, celery and onions.

start: 80.0
end: 82.0
text:  Those are going to go in just after the pancetta.

start: 82.0
end: 84.0
text:  After the pancetta crisps a little bit.

start: 84.0
end: 87.0
text:  And we'll stir those in and start sauteing those as well.

start: 87.0
end: 90.0
text:  So onions. Just finely diced onion.

start: 93.0
end: 95.0
text:  A little bit of carrot and celery.

start: 97.0
end: 99.0
text:  These are the base for most things that you cook.

start: 99.0
end: 101.0
text:  They tie everything together really nicely.

start: 102.0
end: 103.0
text:  Again just stir this.

start: 109.0
end: 111.0
text:  So while this is cooking I'll add my dry spices.

start: 111.0
end: 118.0
text:  I have some basil, oregano, dried basil, dried oregano and marjoram.

start: 120.0
end: 123.0
text:  Which are going to give you that nice base sort of Italian flavours.

start: 123.0
end: 125.0
text:  I'm going to add a little bit of chopped garlic.

start: 127.0
end: 130.0
text:  And once you add your chopped garlic you want to be careful that you stir it lots.

start: 130.0
end: 132.0
text:  Garlic has a very high sugar content.

start: 132.0
end: 134.0
text:  So it has a tendency to burn.

start: 135.0
end: 137.0
text:  So make sure that you keep moving it around the bottom of your pot.

start: 138.0
end: 140.0
text:  And then the last thing is a bay leaf.

start: 140.0
end: 142.0
text:  Just one bay leaf, dried or fresh.

start: 143.0
end: 147.0
text:  If it's fresh I like to kind of crack it a little bit to help the flavours and oils come out of it.

start: 147.0
end: 149.0
text:  We'll just throw that in whole.

start: 149.0
end: 152.0
text:  And at the end of the cooking process we'll have to remember to take that out.

start: 153.0
end: 156.0
text:  So this is just going to saute together until your vegetables are soft.

start: 157.0
end: 161.0
text:  Once your vegetables get kind of soft, your onions start to get translucent.

start: 161.0
end: 163.0
text:  We're just going to throw a little bit of white wine in.

start: 163.0
end: 166.0
text:  And the white wine is going to help us deglaze the bottom of the pan.

start: 166.0
end: 168.0
text:  Get all those great pancetta flavours.

start: 168.0
end: 170.0
text:  Tie everything together.

start: 171.0
end: 175.0
text:  If you didn't have wine or you didn't want to use wine, you could certainly use a little bit of stock or even water.

start: 175.0
end: 179.0
text:  You just want to make sure that you get all those little bits off the bottom of your pan.

start: 179.0
end: 182.0
text:  And then you want to bring this up to over a medium high heat.

start: 182.0
end: 185.0
text:  And reduce the liquid until it's almost gone.

start: 185.0
end: 187.0
text:  You want to cook out as much of that wine as you can.

start: 190.0
end: 192.0
text:  Okay so my wine is almost reduced.

start: 192.0
end: 194.0
text:  I've reduced this so it's almost dry again.

start: 194.0
end: 199.0
text:  As you can see there's the dried spices and the carrots, the vegetables in there.

start: 199.0
end: 202.0
text:  Onions, celery, pancetta are all really really great.

start: 202.0
end: 205.0
text:  So what I want to do now is add my soaked beans.

start: 205.0
end: 207.0
text:  These are dry cannellini beans.

start: 207.0
end: 212.0
text:  You can buy dried beans at most grocery stores or a bulk store.

start: 212.0
end: 214.0
text:  They're super inexpensive. They last forever.

start: 214.0
end: 217.0
text:  And then what we did here was soaked them overnight.

start: 217.0
end: 220.0
text:  So we filled them up in a large non-reactive bowl.

start: 220.0
end: 222.0
text:  Covered them with cold water.

start: 222.0
end: 224.0
text:  And let them sit in the fridge for about 24 hours.

start: 224.0
end: 227.0
text:  And what that does is helps them grow.

start: 227.0
end: 229.0
text:  They almost double in size.

start: 229.0
end: 232.0
text:  They start absorbing some water and then they'll cook a lot more evenly.

start: 232.0
end: 236.0
text:  So to cook these soaked beans, I just want to put them into my pressure cooker now.

start: 238.0
end: 242.0
text:  On top of that I'm going to pour in some chicken stock or chicken broth.

start: 244.0
end: 246.0
text:  So we'll pour that in.

start: 246.0
end: 248.0
text:  And now I want to bring this up to a boil.

start: 248.0
end: 253.0
text:  And at this point, this is where we're going to start utilizing the pressure in the pressure cooker.

start: 253.0
end: 256.0
text:  So you want to bring this up to a boil before we put the lid on.

start: 257.0
end: 260.0
text:  So over high heat, this is going to start heating up.

start: 260.0
end: 262.0
text:  So the lid now has a couple of parts.

start: 262.0
end: 265.0
text:  And what this is going to do is we're going to put it on.

start: 265.0
end: 267.0
text:  And I'll talk a little bit about the lid.

start: 267.0
end: 269.0
text:  So before you put your pressure cooker on,

start: 269.0
end: 271.0
text:  you always want to make sure that you check this rubber seal.

start: 271.0
end: 272.0
text:  And make sure that it's in good repair.

start: 272.0
end: 274.0
text:  There's no cracks or signs of wear on it.

start: 274.0
end: 277.0
text:  There's a safety valve which is there for safety.

start: 277.0
end: 281.0
text:  There's a little bit of a steam release valve which controls how much steam goes off.

start: 281.0
end: 283.0
text:  And on the other side of that sits a bobber.

start: 283.0
end: 289.0
text:  And this will rock back and forth and just control the amount of steam that's coming out of the pressure cooker.

start: 289.0
end: 291.0
text:  And the last thing is this safety valve.

start: 291.0
end: 293.0
text:  So this is actually a safety pin.

start: 293.0
end: 296.0
text:  That once your pressure cooker comes up to pressure,

start: 296.0
end: 300.0
text:  this pin will push up and it locks everything in place so that you can't open the lid.

start: 300.0
end: 302.0
text:  There's actually a safety mechanism built into this.

start: 302.0
end: 305.0
text:  So to put the lid on, you can see this is flanged.

start: 305.0
end: 308.0
text:  And then there is the flanges on the top of your pressure cooker.

start: 308.0
end: 310.0
text:  So what I want to do is there's a little arrow.

start: 310.0
end: 314.0
text:  And you want to line up the arrow on the handle and on the lid.

start: 314.0
end: 316.0
text:  They line up very nicely.

start: 316.0
end: 320.0
text:  And then the handle comes together in two pieces and locks into place.

start: 320.0
end: 325.0
text:  Once it's locked into place, we can place our bobber on top.

start: 325.0
end: 327.0
text:  And we'll just wait for the safety pin to come up.

start: 327.0
end: 330.0
text:  Once the pin comes up, that means you've achieved high pressure.

start: 330.0
end: 335.0
text:  At that point, you want to adjust your heat to control the pin to still be risen

start: 335.0
end: 338.0
text:  so that you know you're at high pressure and not letting it fall.

start: 338.0
end: 341.0
text:  And once the pin comes up, this is going to cook for 17 minutes.

start: 341.0
end: 344.0
text:  So in 17 minutes, we're going to go from soaked beans

start: 344.0
end: 347.0
text:  to completely cooked beans that are tender all the way through.

start: 347.0
end: 352.0
text:  So our pasta fagioli has been cooking in the pressure cooker for 17 minutes at high pressure.

start: 352.0
end: 355.0
text:  I've turned it off the heat and cooled it down completely

start: 355.0
end: 358.0
text:  so that the safety mechanism has unlocked.

start: 358.0
end: 360.0
text:  So now I can safely open the lid.

start: 360.0
end: 362.0
text:  It'll open no problem.

start: 362.0
end: 365.0
text:  And it's still hot in there. You can see the steam still coming out.

start: 365.0
end: 368.0
text:  My beans should be cooked so that they're nice and tender.

start: 368.0
end: 371.0
text:  All of those flavours have imparted into the beans.

start: 371.0
end: 374.0
text:  So now what I want to do is stir in some canned tomatoes.

start: 374.0
end: 377.0
text:  We like to use San Marzano-style canned tomatoes.

start: 377.0
end: 383.0
text:  It's an Italian-style tomato that comes packed in tomato juice as opposed to water.

start: 383.0
end: 386.0
text:  Some brands of canned tomatoes come packed with water.

start: 386.0
end: 390.0
text:  The ones that say San Marzano or the San Marzano tomatoes from Italy

start: 390.0
end: 393.0
text:  are generally a higher quality and it will give you a better product in the end.

start: 393.0
end: 396.0
text:  So I'm just going to pour these through.

start: 396.0
end: 399.0
text:  Some tomato.

start: 399.0
end: 403.0
text:  And then I'm going to turn it back on the heat and leave this uncovered.

start: 403.0
end: 407.0
text:  So I have my can of tomato and then I have a cup of pasta as well.

start: 407.0
end: 411.0
text:  We're using elbow macaroni but you could use any small pasta just to cook through.

start: 411.0
end: 415.0
text:  This is going to help absorb some of the liquid and make a delicious dish.

start: 416.0
end: 420.0
text:  So now what I want to do is, this is going to take as long as the pasta takes.

start: 420.0
end: 423.0
text:  So about 9 minutes to cook the pasta all the way through.

start: 423.0
end: 426.0
text:  I just want to stir it around, bring it up to a high heat.

start: 426.0
end: 429.0
text:  The liquid is going to boil away, those tomatoes are going to break down

start: 429.0
end: 433.0
text:  and we'll give you a beautiful pasta product that is best served right away.

start: 433.0
end: 436.0
text:  So a very simple dish that you can serve to your family.
