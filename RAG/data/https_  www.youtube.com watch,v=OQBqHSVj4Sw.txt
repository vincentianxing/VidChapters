text:  Hi, it's Jaden from SteamyKitchen.com.

start: 8.36
end: 13.14
text:  I love the crispy outside of pot stickers just as much as I love the filling.

start: 13.14
end: 18.400000000000002
text:  So I created these pot stickers so that one, they're easy, super, super easy to fold, and

start: 18.400000000000002
end: 23.400000000000002
text:  two, they have maximum crispiness on the outside.

start: 23.4
end: 31.74
text:  These are my vegetarian version with shiitake mushrooms, tofu, and cabbage.

start: 31.74
end: 36.28
text:  What I love about pot stickers is that you can fold a hundred of them or even more if

start: 36.28
end: 44.36
text:  you want and freeze what you don't eat that day and it becomes a very, very quick 15 minute

start: 44.36
end: 50.04
text:  meal because the dumplings can go from freezer to the pan straight away without defrosting.

start: 50.04
end: 52.0
text:  Okay, here's the filling.

start: 52.0
end: 58.68
text:  I chopped cabbage, you can chop it with a knife like I did or you can use a big box

start: 58.68
end: 61.88
text:  shredder or you can use your Cuisinart.

start: 61.88
end: 64.32
text:  Add the tofu, doesn't matter what kind of tofu you want.

start: 64.32
end: 68.06
text:  You want to crumble or crumble the tofu if you want.

start: 68.06
end: 73.16
text:  This is shiitake mushroom that I've diced as well, so just mix everything together.

start: 73.16
end: 79.12
text:  I love lots of garlic and ginger, so I add a lot of that to the filling.

start: 79.24000000000001
end: 82.24000000000001
text:  I'm using fresh herbs, so I'm adding fresh Thai basil that I'm just running my knife

start: 82.24000000000001
end: 84.08
text:  through to the filling.

start: 84.08
end: 89.08000000000001
text:  Add all of these aromatics into a small bowl and then pour in your soy sauce.

start: 89.08000000000001
end: 90.08000000000001
text:  Mix this together.

start: 90.08000000000001
end: 95.16
text:  Doing this in a small bowl first before adding it to the big bowl helps it just disperse

start: 95.16
end: 98.36000000000001
text:  evenly throughout all the vegetables.

start: 98.36000000000001
end: 103.72
text:  Here are two different brands of wrappers that I happened to pick up at the Asian market.

start: 103.72
end: 105.72
text:  These come frozen and you have to defrost them.

start: 105.72
end: 111.36
text:  They only take about 40 minutes on the counter to defrost or you can defrost them in the

start: 111.36
end: 117.16
text:  microwave but don't defrost them underwater because they'll get wet and soggy and unusable.

start: 117.16
end: 120.8
text:  The brand on your right is Twin Marquis.

start: 120.8
end: 123.6
text:  It's actually a little thicker than the other brand.

start: 123.6
end: 126.03999999999999
text:  I actually prefer the brand on your left.

start: 126.03999999999999
end: 130.24
text:  It's nice, thin, and very easy to fold.

start: 130.24
end: 135.56
text:  Okay, these are defrosted and there you can see they're really thin and flexible.

start: 135.56
end: 138.48
text:  They're perfect consistency for pot stickers.

start: 138.48
end: 142.76
text:  What holds a pot sticker together is either an egg wash that you can make or just cornstarch

start: 142.76
end: 144.28
text:  and water which is what I use.

start: 144.28
end: 145.76
text:  I like using cornstarch and water.

start: 145.76
end: 147.38
text:  It's just easier.

start: 147.38
end: 149.68
text:  Add a scant tablespoon of filling.

start: 149.68
end: 150.88
text:  Don't overstuff them.

start: 150.88
end: 151.88
text:  They'll burst.

start: 151.88
end: 157.82
text:  Paint around the edges of the skin and fold them in half and make sure that everything

start: 157.82
end: 163.24
text:  is, that there's no air in the pot sticker so push out the air and make sure that all

start: 163.24
end: 164.44
text:  the edges are sealed tightly.

start: 164.44
end: 165.44
text:  Okay, not sealed tightly.

start: 165.44
end: 170.8
text:  Then they open up and then oil seeps in and the spilling falls out, etc. etc.

start: 170.8
end: 173.6
text:  Alright, here's another one.

start: 173.6
end: 177.56
text:  Don't add too much filling again and just fold it in half into a half moon.

start: 177.56
end: 182.24
text:  I squeeze the middle first and make sure that that's sealed and then seal the rest of the

start: 182.24
end: 186.12
text:  edges and make sure that there's no air, air bubbles.

start: 186.12
end: 191.92
text:  And then I go over one more time with my fingers just to make sure that it's sealed correctly.

start: 192.39999999999998
end: 198.72
text:  Now for those of you who like to get a little bit more fancy, here is the real way of folding

start: 198.72
end: 199.72
text:  pot stickers.

start: 199.72
end: 207.07999999999998
text:  Again, fold them in the middle and make sure it's tight in the middle and pleat one side

start: 207.07999999999998
end: 209.56
text:  towards the center just like this.

start: 209.56
end: 213.51999999999998
text:  I do three pleats on each side and make sure that that's sealed correctly.

start: 213.51999999999998
end: 217.83999999999997
text:  And then I'm going to go on the other side and I'm going to pleat towards the center.

start: 217.83999999999997
end: 218.83999999999997
text:  Three on each side.

start: 218.83999999999997
end: 219.83999999999997
text:  You can do two or three on each side.

start: 219.83999999999997
end: 220.83999999999997
text:  It doesn't matter.

start: 221.84
end: 225.52
text:  And then I go over it one more time on the edge to make sure it's tight.

start: 225.52
end: 234.0
text:  And now you can see it's like a nice cute little dumpling that stands up and also can

start: 234.0
end: 236.0
text:  â€“ what am I saying?

start: 236.0
end: 237.0
text:  I don't know.

start: 237.0
end: 238.0
text:  Here it is again.

start: 238.0
end: 240.08
text:  Here's a different angle.

start: 240.08
end: 245.36
text:  I'm pleating towards the center and I'm only folding one side which gives a nice curve

start: 245.36
end: 246.36
text:  just like this.

start: 247.36
end: 252.0
text:  Go over it one more time with my fingers.

start: 252.0
end: 254.96
text:  Make sure it's super tight and that's it.

start: 254.96
end: 256.56
text:  So you can fold them either way.

start: 256.56
end: 258.96000000000004
text:  I like both.

start: 258.96000000000004
end: 264.12
text:  The first way is much easier so if you've got kids or you want to do them super fast,

start: 264.12
end: 265.48
text:  you can do it that way.

start: 265.48
end: 270.64
text:  Plus the first way gives you maximum exposure to crispiness in the pan.

start: 270.64
end: 276.64
text:  Heat a pan, nonstick pan, with cooking oil and once it starts shimmering a bit, go ahead

start: 276.64
end: 281.2
text:  and add the potstickers and let them fry for a couple minutes until they are browned.

start: 281.2
end: 282.96
text:  Not burnt but just browned.

start: 282.96
end: 283.96
text:  Turn them over.

start: 283.96
end: 286.4
text:  You can see that nice crispy edge forming.

start: 286.4
end: 288.71999999999997
text:  Okay, this is where the steaming part comes in.

start: 288.71999999999997
end: 294.4
text:  You're going to add just a couple tablespoons of water to the pan.

start: 294.4
end: 301.0
text:  Close it with a tight lid and let the water steam and finish cooking the potstickers.

start: 301.0
end: 303.35999999999996
text:  After a few minutes, they are done!

start: 303.35999999999996
end: 304.35999999999996
text:  They're ready to serve.

start: 304.35999999999996
end: 310.52
text:  The water has evaporated and just put them on a plate and serve them.

start: 310.52
end: 315.44
text:  Remember I said that you could freeze these and then go direct from freezer to the pan?

start: 315.44
end: 317.84
text:  Well you can do that.

start: 317.84
end: 322.56
text:  Once you take them out of the freezer, you want to place them one by one in the pan with

start: 322.56
end: 326.44
text:  a little bit of oil and remember just be careful.

start: 326.44
end: 330.44
text:  Make sure that they don't overlap each other too much in the pan and just add a couple

start: 330.44
end: 333.0
text:  of minutes to the cooking time.
