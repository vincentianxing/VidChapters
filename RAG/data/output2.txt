Video ID: Lobster Scrambled Eggs Recipe - Leftover Lobster Recipe

Result:   hello this is Chef John from foodwishes.com with lobster scrambled eggs that's right I'm going to help solve one of America's biggest home cooking dilemmas what to do with all that leftover lobster hey we've all been there anyway all kidding aside you may in fact one day have leftover lobster and scrambled eggs is a fantastic way to use them up so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a saute pan on medium low heat with a nice chunk of butter when the butter melts I'm going to add my Lobster chunks you'll notice they're still in Fairly large pieces you don't want to dice it up like I've seen in some recipes you want to know you're eating lobster OK Google I'm going to add my age to which I've added a couple tablespoons of  Peregrine leaves one of my favorite favorite Seafood herbs especially with lobster just a perfect perfect pairing I'm going to turn the heat up to medium I'm going to take a spatula I'm obviously using a nonstick pan here and I'm going to keep it moving until it's done are you got to keep it moving I don't want big chunks of rubbery scrambled eggs and lobster I want this very very very very very soft and very very custody now the only other times I've made this I've actually scrambled eggs first and then when they were almost done I folded the lobster meat in which does work but here I want to try something different I want to start with the Lobster in the pan and I wanted to scramble the eggs with the lobster to possibly more Lobster flavor into the dish the risk of course is overcooking the lobster which I'm happy to announce did not happen all right and again very important you keep it moving keep that spatula scraping against the bottom of the pan so that  what part of the egg stays in one place too long so I'm going to keep it moving keep it moving when it got to this point and it was almost there I stopped why because by the time you put the spatula down and you get your warm plate and you go ahead and you serve it up it continues to cook from the residual heat in the Lobster in the eggs so if you think okay it's almost where I want it stop put it on the plate by the time you dig your fork in it's going to be absolutely perfect and there you go a little bit of toast cup of coffee and you are in breakfast heaven so next time you have a bunch of leftover lobster hanging around I know happens all the time you should give this a try super great way to use it up all right so I'm going to dig in here and you can see that customer sweet buttery taste luxurious texture that little bit of anisette flavor from the tarragon kind of a licorice flavor  profile just fantastic with this and my theory about cooking the lobster with the eggs instead of adding at the end totally worked this really did have a stronger Lobster flavor than the other version I described really really delicious I hope you give this a try check out foodwishes.com for all the ingredient amounts as usual and as always enjoy

I'm going to quickly cover it we're going to reduce the flame down to low  and we're simply going to simmer slowly for 15 minutes and after 15 minutes we're simply going to turn off the heat and let it sit there covered for another 5 minutes and then it's ready to fluff and add to the rest of the ingredients which is what we're going to be prepping while the quinoa Cooks so we're going to go ahead and dice up some smoked ham you can see I've already mixed up some garlic cut up some red pepper cut up some green onions mostly the white Parts I'm going to save some of the green tops for the end as usual and because quinoa is such a small little grain by the way it's not a grain it's a seed but anyway because it's such a small seed we don't want our garnish to be too big so nice small dice on this stuff going to work perfectly and once that's prep we're going to take a big old frying pan we're going to place it on medium heat and then we're going to put just a little bit of vegetable oil maybe a tablespoon we're going to keep this much much much much much lighter than a traditional pork fried rice we're going to dump in the house the peppers and onions and we're going to cook that for about I don't know five minutes or so we definitely want to keep some texture in the onions and peppers  but we do want the edges of the ham to kind of caramelize a little bit that always sweetens it up brings out that beautiful Smoky flavor you'll also notice will be a little bit of a fond building up on the bottom of the pan that's actually going to get deglazed off by the moisture from the quinoa so stay tuned for that and once our ham is cooked we have one last step we're going to throw in the minced garlic we're going to turn off the heat and we're just going to stir that around I don't want that garlic to Brown and there's plenty of heat in the pan and it's also going to continue to cook when we put in the quinoa so that's why I'm turning off the heat at this point by the way you can do this part of ahead of time and just continue on when you are cooked but I did mine simultaneously so this point my quinoa was done it for five minutes I removed the lid we're going to fluff it up a little bit look at that so pretty absorbed but it's certainly not dry those will be tender but not mushy they're still going to have a little bit of a bite to them so that's perfect I'm going to go ahead and dump that into the frying pan we can put our heat back on medium low and we're supposed to take  spoon or spatula and just stir that in to the ham onion pepper mixture and you remember what I said about that little bit of caramelization at the bottom of the pan there's a little bit of moisture on the quinoa it's going to absorb all that flavor and color so I'm just going to stir that around for about 2 minutes and then to finish we're going to season this with a little bit of seasoned rice vinegar a little splash of soy sauce and then of course I need a little heat mine I'm going to use a little short to hot sauce anything spicy would be delicious if you want to throw an egg in here like regular fried rice go ahead I don't think it works as well as it does with rice so I didn't put the egg but feel free in fact next time I might try to touch day which I think would be amazing and of course because I had them I added a few more of the green onion tops or that in and when I say this is easy I'm not kidding as soon as you make those ingredients and it's all heated through you're ready to eat this is so incredibly fast and simple this is like the dream weeknight dinner especially if you're doing this with leftover quinoa or quinoa you cooked ahead of time this whole dinner is going to take you about  1520 minutes to do so let's go ahead and play that up I'm going to finish with some toasted sesame seeds all right for me sesame oil a little too strong in this but I do like that subtle nutty note that the sesame seeds provide so I'm going to put a few of those on and there you go pork fried quinoa and we all know how nutritious and awesome quinoa is it's a super food as they say but you know what who cares about superfoods if they don't taste good and with this here that's not a problem this really is so tasty and delicious you will not be thinking for a second you're eating healthy we have no problem with cooking healthy as long as it looks like this and it doesn't taste healthy then everybody wins so I really hope you give this a try head over to food wishes.com for all the ingredients and as always enjoy

Video ID: Cooked Salmon Sashimi Recipe - Sous Vide Cooking

Result:   welcome back to another Sushi video tutorial I'm Chef Deville and today I'm going to show you guys how to make something spectacular something impossible something revolutionary something Innovative is possibly the future of sushi although it might not be who knows but what's certain is over the last 100 years old so much from something it took 6 months to make by fermenting rice and fish together to something so this could be the future basically I use a sous vide machine to cook the fish to an exact temperature 40 degrees Celsius  are you the first thing you want to do is you want to get a nice piece of salmon with the grain going right across and you don't want a curving of the grain so I cut it specifically to be like so now you just want to make the brine which is simply 500 mL of water and then 6% sold and 4% sugar I just want to let the dogs out and then add your fish go  and then I'm just going to add 40 G of extra virgin olive oil Perfect all right so this part is very easy you just put it inside your vacuum sealer make sure it's line properly close it and see perfectly 25 minutes to 27 minutes 27 minutes 25 minutes 27 minutes  I want it cooked what I'm going to do here is just take a butter knife and get right in between the layers of fat and separated like so this piece is little bit small and just like so they come off pretty easy and it's almost like Sashimi slices but not quite because it's not okay and this is so soft it's just incredible play so you play tonight in between the fat lady and she's just slide in and just comes off the fish like so it's extremely soft because what's happened during the soft cookies  add fish is just so soft and juicy that it just falls apart  I want to watch the inside can be fixed in place okay perfect I hope you guys enjoyed watching how to make this delicately cook salmon sashimi and if you want to make it without the screen machine as possible but it will take a lot of effort you have to sit there and turn the gas on and off and watch it with at the moment for 27 minutes which would be hell so I would suggest just making the investment is the same as any other cooking machine in your kitchen it's it costs money so if you want to buy it you can use it anyway I guess that's everything and I guess another word  between cooked and raw is  32 share this video and many of my other videos on Google Plus Facebook Twitter whatever your social media poison is and if you want to show your appreciation anymore then you can do so right now by clicking on the bottom right on patreon.com and that's basically everything if you want to see more videos every single week then subscribe to my channel

Video ID: Oven Fried Chicken That Tastes Like Deep Fried!  Healthy -  Rockin Robin Cooks

Result:   hi everyone I'm Rockin Robin from cooking Mexican recipes.com and today I'm going to show you how to make some oven fried chicken we're going to season this with some bread crumbs with some Italian seasonings in that and I'll tell you it's just a little bit healthier than your typical pan-fried chicken so in the cleanup is so much easier you don't have all that grease splatter all over your stove and you don't have to worry about getting rid of all that extra oil that you've used to cook the chicken in so don't go away I'll be right back to tell you all about it so let me go over the ingredients with you so we can get started with our oven fried chicken so basically  what you want to do is I just grabbed a paper towel and I loosen the skin up and then I use the paper towel to pull back on the skin and I tell you it's a vise grip that just really makes it easy it just pulls it right off you have a nice grip on it so that works beautifully to do it that way okay so our other ingredients are are coating here I've got an egg which I'm going to beat up in a minute and my seasoned bread crumbs now these are Italian seasoned bread crumbs which means they have some spices in them already and I really like this I bought this at Whole Foods it's the 365 brand so if you want to try that you can if you don't have seasoned bread crumbs or you have a hard time finding it I'm going to leave a little recipe for you in the description below this video so you can do your own if you like and we'll need a little bit of a quarter of a cup and the ratio to the bread crumbs that's about a cup and then the other item that you'll need is some real butter this is organic butter I had one of  play fans are my my viewers to my channel asked me to State when I use organic ingredients so there you go and we'll probably add just a little more salt and a little bit of pepper and that's all we'll need I want to mention that you want to be preheating your oven right now to you know 425 degrees all right so what I'm going to do on this plate here is I'm just going to combine my seasoned bread crumbs with the flower  and just toss it around until it's all covered shake off any excess and then just lay it on your baking sheet now I'm using a Pampered Chef it's like a clay baking sheet and I like to use that it's not Teflon and it works beautifully so I'm going to go ahead and continue coating the rest of my chicken and we'll go from there so with the amount of bread crumbs and even the egg that I had left over you could easily make six even eight pieces of chicken so I just wanted to show you that all I wanted for today for myself is four so that's why I have some leftover bread crumbs so yeah and you can use certainly use chicken breasts legs whatever you want to do as well so now all we have left to do is if you want to just a little bit more salt just give it a little sprinkle on top of each piece just a little bit and maybe a little pepper  last thing is butter so I had my butter in the refrigerator so it's nice and cold I'm peeling off a nice thin piece of butter can you see that can you see how thin that is going to show you that in just a second here but you have to have your butter nice and cold in order to be able to do that okay so what I do is I take my knife and I go across the top and I make a very thin sliver of butter and hopefully you can see that it's just like paper paper thin and then I place that on top of the chicken so I'm not adding too much butter but just enough and everybody makes fun of me but because I do that to the butter sometimes I go across the top and then I've got this big you know Valley in the butter in their butt like I said it's got to be cold to do that so I just put a song on top and I'll show you that here in just a second just so you know you got some moisture because I took the skin off of the chicken and there's no  bread crumbs moistened and this butter will drip down and get on the bottom as well and then the bottom will also get nice and brown so here's the chicken here you can see where I placed the very thin slices of butter on top and that's pretty much it so we're going to play this in the oven remember I told you to set it 4:25 so we'll go do that now and we're going to check it in about 15 minutes it'll probably take you know half an hour total we'll put in for 15 minutes okay so you can see here I'm going to play this in the oven and I have it on the lower third of the racket in 15 minutes all right here we go we're going to check the chicken  starting to turn a nice golden brown okay here we go and we're going to let that go for another probably 18 minutes I'm going to go all right so here's our chicken after about 35 minutes it's a beautiful golden brown and I'm just going to go ahead and cut into it you can use an instant read thermometer  so yeah I guess you got to give this a try so do try my oven fried chicken I know you're going to really enjoy it it's easy to cook it's easy to clean up you don't have all that extra oil that you have to dispose of so yeah give it a try I'm really sure you're going to love this so go ahead and subscribe to my channel

Video ID: How to Make Sichuan Kung Bao Chicken 宫保雞丁 (Kung Pao Chicken)

Result:   hello and welcome to the art of cooking today we're going to make gumballs eating or kung pao chicken as it is known in the west now as you might notice there is actually no vegetables in this dish well that's because this version is actually the original Citroen version which uses chicken as is primary ingredient the characteristics of this dish is tender chicken crispy peanuts with a combination of numbing spicy sweet and sour sauce let's prepare by starting the sauce first one teaspoon of sugar one tablespoon of rice wine 1 1/2 tablespoons of soy sauce and 1/4 teaspoon of salt this is optional 2 teaspoon of chili oil one teaspoon of hot pepper powder or chili powder this is optional a fourth cup or 60 mL of chicken stock or water and start also another additional ingredients of black vinegar did not mix it with the sauce three clothes or one tablespoon  send garlic 1 tablespoon of minced ginger top three sprigs of green onions separate the white part from the green part the green part will be used as a garnish while the white part would be used for cooking cut 12 to 150 CM then cut it into your thoughts  1/4 tsp of salt 1 tbsp of soy sauce one tablespoon of salt and rice wine or regular rice wine mix until all the liquids are absorbed what's all the liquids are absorbed I don't want tablespoon of cornstarch so it should look like this once it's like this at a half a tablespoon of oil and mix this oil will actually prevents it from sticking to the walk so when you cook it separates the slurry one teaspoon of potato starch plus one teaspoon of water now let's get cooking in a walk or pan at a funeral turn the fire to the lowest setting I did something for about 15 to 20 seconds or until fragrant  turn the chicken and spread that leg out cuz it's getting hot in here turn the heat to medium setting and let it cook for about 30 seconds before flipping the chicken over ladies and gentlemen as you have absorbed despite the low heat the chicken didn't stick to the wall That's because of the oil that we put in the marinade cook the other side for about 20 seconds then add in the green onions garlic and ginger and stir fry for about 20 to 30 seconds I didn't the sauce and let it cook in the sauce for about 20 seconds at this point the chicken is about 60 to 70% and relatively thin the time to cook the thighs is round 3 minutes no more than 4 minutes at this point I don't understand turn off the heat and add in half cup or 75 grams of roasted peanuts mix until the peanuts are well combined with the sauce lastly with the fire off add in the black vinegar and quickly mix the reason we  the vinaigrette the last stage of cooking with the fire off is because we don't want to lose the city of the vinegar if you added with the other sauce you basically cook away the city of the vinegar by the way just FYI when I use walk for stir-frying I always hated the walk until it's hot then turn off the fire and add in cold water is still hot but cold enough that it doesn't actually burn the food while at the same time producing a non-stick surface oh one more thing I forgot to mention after you use a flavor into the oil you may want to remove the peppercorns from the oil unless you want to piss someone off then leave them in there which I did and I pissed my brother thank you for watching and I hope you enjoy this tutorial please like favor and leave a comment below thank you   






Video ID: Vegetable Spring Rolls (Egg Rolls)

Result:   what are food processor or you can buy already precut Matchstick cut carrots or you can use my favorite way with this $512 which does it very very quickly I use a fork to anchor down the carrot and look how thin and beautiful these Julian slices are just going to cut down the length just a bit these are canned bamboo shoots you'll find them in the Asian aisle I drain them and I'm just going to run my knife through them just to make them similar shape and size as the carrots now for the mushrooms you can use fresh shiitake mushrooms if you like or really any type of mushrooms you want but these are dried Chinese mushroom they come in dried form just like this and you rehydrate them by soaking them in water at incredible flavors slavery deep mushroom flavor that you really can't get with just fresh mushrooms so that's why I love using dried Chinese mushrooms cut off and discard the tough stem and chop up the cat these are being  which is really the root and keep the rest of it when I was little my mom used to make me do this all the time it was so incredibly tedious so you know what I'm sorry Mom I'm not going to do it just throwing it all in heat up a walk or a large saute pan and adding your ginger garlic and green onion keep your heat on low you don't want to burn these aromatics add in the vegetables everything but the bean sprouts add the bean sprouts in later because you want them to stay crisp and crunchy stir fry and now when it's almost towards the end of the stir fry adding your bean sprouts seasoned with soy sauce here's a secret vegetables out on a baking sheet this cools down the feeling very quickly the reason why this is important is because if you try to use hot steaming hot filling to wrap with it'll make the  the skin of the egg roll really soggy also another tip prop up the baking sheet so that any extra oil or sausages collects at the bottom and you can throw that away discard that any extra liquid this helps prevent your egg roll again from being soggy mix cool water with cornstarch to make a slurry this is sort of your glue you can also use an egg wash if you want but I like using cornstarch and water this is my very favorite brand of egg roll wrappers are spring rolls you get these at the Asian market you'll find them in the frozen section and you'll defrost them in the refrigerator overnight or just leave them out on your counter for about 45 minutes they are incredibly thin and very very light and they crisp up like crazy the rappers that you can find at regular supermarkets that are not frozen the vegetable aisle I don't like that they Bubble Up and they're just too doughy so  always buy these rappers another good brand that I also buy is called Spring Hill tip keep them wrapped up in plastic wrap or a damp paper towel because they will try out very easily and it's very hard to roll make sure it works surfaces dry and clean that's all so very important lay down your wrapper in a diamond shape add about a heaping tablespoon of filling you don't want to add too much because it'll burst if you add too much filling roll them up super super tight put your finger right there to make a fold a nice Hospital Corner fold and again on the other side and roll all the way up now this is what you do not want to do do you see how it looks a little wide there and there's basically an opening oils very oily so you want to make sure that you're folding them so that there's no air bubbles no pockets and no holes paint the remaining Corners with the cornstarch slurry and roll all the way up  and pulling back tugging back just a bit every time just so that you've got a very tight role and that is it okay I'll show you again step one is to wipe down your surface lay down the egg roll wrapper and a diamond shape and add just about a heaping tablespoon of filling into this corner bottom corner right here roll up tightly roll up that corner and tug back just a bit just to make sure it's tight use your finger to pinch fold down the west of the way up paint the two corners with the cornstarch slurry I'll show you what it looks like it should look tight small maybe about an inch and a quarter in diameter and no visible holes put them lay them flat on a baking sheet can make sure you cover that with a damp towel a very very damp towel or plastic wrap to prevent them from drying there's another tip if you like to freeze them freeze them just like this or just make sure that they are  all on a single layer try not to have them touch freeze them first and then once they are frozen you can gather them up and put them in a freezer bag if you try to squish them too tight or have them overlapping while in the freezer they'll just freeze in a giant Clump and then you won't be able to get them apart and to cook them Frozen all you have to do is put them directly frozen into the hot oil just be very careful you don't need to defrost them okay back to the fresh egg rolls I've got some hot oil and I've got a baking sheet with a racks to drain them and I'm going to make sure that the oil is hot enough here's a tip that I learned from my mom take a uncoated chopstick or a wooden spoon the handle of a wooden spoon and place it in the oil I promise you're not going to damage your Chopstick or wooden spoon place it into the oil and if you see no bubbles it's not quite ready yet when you do see bubbles that's when your oil is hot enough to fry call the ancient Chinese thermometer you can see here that it's not quite ready yet  slide in the egg rolls very carefully don't make sure you don't splatter yourself and just fry until Brown remember they filling is already cooked inside we stir fry that earlier so it really all you're doing is Browning the outside when I also wanted to tell you how my dad likes to enjoy the egg rolls you take one bite from the egg roll and pour in a little bit of Chinese black vinegar or if you don't have Chinese black vinegar just a little bit of balsamic vinegar and the sweet Tangy sharpness of the vinegar oh it's perfect for Chinese egg rolls for the full recipe or if you have any questions at all head over to steamy

Video ID: Buttermilk Fried Chicken

Result:   hello this is Chef John from foodwishes.com with my recipe for buttermilk fried chicken one of my favorite recipes of all time and not that hard to put together and just for fun I'm going to show you how I break down a whole chicken for fried chicken I'm going to take off the wingtips those are useless I'm going to DJ joint the wings right with the attached to the body all right the thigh leg section comes off don't be afraid to snap and dislocate and then that gets caught between the drumstick and the thigh yes this is quick but go back and watch it you know 78 times are done I'm left with basically the carcass which has the backbone and the breast and you'll notice I'm using a nice heavy Cleaver the ultimate tool for chicken break down the backbone like that cut the breast in half and then each breast gets cut in two pieces and you'll notice here when I cut the breast in half I said the bone and then I give it one pound with my hands so it goes through in one shot nice and clean otherwise you get like bone  there's my four breast pieces my two thighs  it gets dredged in that seasoned flour well there you want it really nicely coated give it a little shake off put on a plate and then we're ready to fry and what we're going to do and there's lots of different ways to fry this I'm going to take a dutch oven that's a big 8 quart dutch oven and I have about two and a half quarts of oil in there and I'm going to fry all eight pieces at once now some people like to fry in a skillet and just like an inch or two of oil and then they do it in batches and they turn it halfway through you know I don't have the patience I want to be done at the same time of course this is twice the oil but you know what how often do you make fried chicken like once a year so at 3:50 I'm going to cook that for about 10 minutes it's going to develop a nice crust I'm going to go in after 10 minutes and just move it around a little just in case some pieces are stuck together I want to cook evenly that's going to go for about another 10 to 15 minutes so it's about 20-25 minutes total in the hot oil to cook all the way through  and I was finishing up I'd like to take a rack and put it on some paper towels on a sheet pan and that's why I'm going to use to drain the cooked chicken on all right so that's ready and the chicken's ready look at that unbelievably beautiful so again it's been about 20 to 25 minutes total in the oil I'm going to fish it out with my spider that little strainer thing you see there and what beautiful chicken and possibly crispy amazingly delicious don't bite into it for about 10 minutes cuz it's so hot you won't enjoy it you just burn yourself so 10 minutes later we had a delicious plate of fried chicken and I just could not bring myself to eat this in front of you but trust me it was every bit as good as it looks that is not a hard recipe it does take a little bit of work but completely worth it so like I said 11:55 cuz all the ingredients are listed there and as always enjoy
