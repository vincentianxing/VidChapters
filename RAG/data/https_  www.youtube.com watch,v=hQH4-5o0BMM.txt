start: 0.0
end: 2.84
text:  This is the only spaghetti and meat sauce

start: 2.84
end: 4.04
text:  you'll ever make again.

start: 4.04
end: 6.34
text:  It only takes 30 minutes to prepare.

start: 6.34
end: 8.46
text:  It's healthy, loaded with veggies.

start: 8.46
end: 10.38
text:  It's delicious, full of flavor,

start: 10.38
end: 13.0
text:  and you can make it for dinner any night of the week.

start: 13.0
end: 15.46
text:  So first, we're gonna prep all of our veggies.

start: 15.46
end: 20.46
text:  I have the onion, garlic, carrot, and celery.

start: 21.0
end: 23.5
text:  For the onion, I'm just gonna give it a rough chop.

start: 25.060000000000002
end: 27.16
text:  And since time is of the essence here,

start: 27.16
end: 29.7
text:  we're gonna put everything into the food processor.

start: 30.72
end: 33.72
text:  So since I'm throwing everything into the food processor,

start: 33.72
end: 36.88
text:  I want it to be similar size pieces

start: 36.88
end: 39.8
text:  with the onion, the carrots, and the celery.

start: 39.8
end: 42.92
text:  That way, everything gets chopped up evenly.

start: 44.08
end: 47.0
text:  And then garlic, let's do five cloves.

start: 50.0
end: 53.36
text:  And then our carrot, I'm going with a pretty large size one

start: 53.36
end: 55.8
text:  because you really want it packed with veggies.

start: 55.8
end: 57.64
text:  You can go either way with peeling it,

start: 57.64
end: 58.480000000000004
text:  or not peeling it.

start: 58.480000000000004
end: 59.8
text:  If you have the time, peel it.

start: 59.8
end: 62.04
text:  If you don't, you can leave it whole.

start: 62.04
end: 64.04
text:  Just make sure you give it a good wash.

start: 64.04
end: 66.6
text:  Again, just similar size chunks.

start: 67.68
end: 69.96000000000001
text:  And then our celery.

start: 69.96000000000001
end: 73.64
text:  I think the addition of the carrot and the celery

start: 73.64
end: 77.12
text:  really adds like a nice sweetness to our sauce.

start: 77.12
end: 79.04
text:  And I use the leaves too.

start: 80.68
end: 83.68
text:  We're gonna give it a whirl until you get small pieces.

start: 83.68
end: 86.28
text:  Just make sure that you're not cutting it too thin.

start: 86.32000000000001
end: 87.64
text:  And then our onion.

start: 87.64
end: 89.68
text:  I'm gonna cut it into small pieces.

start: 89.68
end: 91.88
text:  Just make sure that it doesn't get too mushy.

start: 91.88
end: 95.08
text:  And this looks about good.

start: 95.08
end: 97.88
text:  And then once that's done, we're basically ready to cook.

start: 97.88
end: 101.44
text:  Okay, so to cook everything, I have a large, heavy pot.

start: 101.44
end: 104.64
text:  And I'm just gonna add a nice glug of olive oil

start: 104.64
end: 105.48
text:  to the bottom.

start: 105.48
end: 107.76
text:  And then we'll turn the heat on to medium high.

start: 107.76
end: 110.16
text:  And once the oil's nice and shimmery,

start: 110.16
end: 112.76
text:  we're gonna add in our chopped vegetables.

start: 112.76
end: 114.8
text:  They really need to cook and caramelize here.

start: 114.8
end: 116.16
text:  And I'm gonna hit it with some salt

start: 116.16
end: 117.8
text:  to really bring out the flavor

start: 117.8
end: 119.84
text:  and make it sweat while it's cooking.

start: 119.84
end: 122.92
text:  So I know it looked like I added a lot of olive oil,

start: 122.92
end: 126.75999999999999
text:  but once you add in the veggies and it starts to saute,

start: 126.75999999999999
end: 131.2
text:  it really absorbs all of that healthy fat.

start: 131.2
end: 132.44
text:  So don't be afraid of it.

start: 134.0
end: 135.2
text:  Oh, it's looking good.

start: 135.2
end: 137.56
text:  So the vegetables are starting to caramelize

start: 137.56
end: 140.12
text:  and you see like brown bits at the bottom.

start: 140.12
end: 142.04
text:  Now it's time to add our meat.

start: 142.04
end: 143.92
text:  I have one pound of ground beef here.

start: 143.92
end: 146.35999999999999
text:  That's an 85, 15 split.

start: 146.35999999999999
end: 148.28
text:  I like using this fat content ratio

start: 148.28
end: 151.56
text:  because I feel like the sauce doesn't get too heavy and rich

start: 151.56
end: 154.44
text:  where you just feel like it has a full layer of oil on top,

start: 154.44
end: 156.6
text:  but this one is nice and balanced.

start: 156.6
end: 159.44
text:  And then I have two links of Italian sausage here.

start: 159.44
end: 160.88
text:  That's about half a pound.

start: 160.88
end: 164.11999999999998
text:  You can just get this at your local butcher or deli section.

start: 164.11999999999998
end: 165.76
text:  Just remove the casing

start: 165.76
end: 167.92
text:  and then we'll add it all in the pot together.

start: 167.92
end: 170.23999999999998
text:  And the combination of these two meats together

start: 170.23999999999998
end: 172.72
text:  really gives the sauce a nice depth of flavor.

start: 172.72
end: 175.44
text:  This is also great because for anyone in your family

start: 175.44
end: 178.96
text:  that's allergic to vegetables, they would never know.

start: 178.96
end: 181.32
text:  The veggies pretty much cling on into the meat

start: 181.32
end: 182.48
text:  and it just becomes one.

start: 182.48
end: 184.72
text:  It also helps to tenderize the meat.

start: 184.72
end: 187.07999999999998
text:  Since we only have 30 minutes to make this,

start: 187.07999999999998
end: 189.84
text:  we don't have the time to really break down the meat

start: 189.84
end: 191.96
text:  and make it tender as you would

start: 191.96
end: 193.72
text:  if you were to cook it for hours on end.

start: 193.72
end: 196.44
text:  So once the meat and the vegetables have combined,

start: 196.44
end: 198.64
text:  we're gonna hit it with some more flavor.

start: 198.64
end: 202.44
text:  I'm adding one tablespoon of dried Italian seasoning.

start: 203.12
end: 203.96
text:  And this is optional,

start: 203.96
end: 206.35999999999999
text:  but I like adding some crushed fennel in there

start: 206.35999999999999
end: 208.0
text:  to give it more of that sausagey,

start: 208.0
end: 209.6
text:  but like sweet fennel flavor

start: 209.6
end: 211.96
text:  that really enhances the dish as well.

start: 211.96
end: 215.16
text:  And then I'm gonna add one whole can of tomato paste.

start: 215.16
end: 217.32
text:  The tomato paste here will give the sauce

start: 217.32
end: 220.92
text:  a deep, rich, concentrated tomato flavor

start: 220.92
end: 223.88
text:  and it's gonna enhance our sauce's overall taste.

start: 223.88
end: 228.32
text:  It's starting to smell so good with the spices,

start: 228.32
end: 230.72
text:  especially the fennel that I added in here.

start: 230.72
end: 234.2
text:  And then the tomato paste and the meat browning.

start: 235.6
end: 237.6
text:  We're almost there, we're almost there.

start: 238.92
end: 241.64
text:  Beautiful caramelization at the bottom.

start: 241.64
end: 242.8
text:  So once we get that,

start: 242.8
end: 246.0
text:  I'm gonna add in a whole can of crushed tomatoes.

start: 246.0
end: 248.88
text:  We'll rinse the can with a little bit of water.

start: 248.88
end: 250.92
text:  I just like to fill it up halfway.

start: 250.92
end: 252.96
text:  Can't waste any of the goodness here.

start: 252.96
end: 256.04
text:  And then my secret sauce, fish sauce.

start: 256.04
end: 258.2
text:  It's basically made out of anchovies

start: 258.24
end: 261.64
text:  and it gives your sauce that umami saltiness

start: 261.64
end: 265.08
text:  that you would normally get if you were to, again,

start: 265.08
end: 267.03999999999996
text:  cook your meat sauce for hours on end.

start: 267.03999999999996
end: 268.56
text:  But this is my shortcut hack

start: 268.56
end: 270.92
text:  to infuse it with that delicious flavor.

start: 270.92
end: 272.28
text:  Just make sure you scrape off

start: 272.28
end: 274.91999999999996
text:  any of the caramelization at the bottom

start: 274.91999999999996
end: 277.0
text:  because that is the flavor.

start: 277.0
end: 278.59999999999997
text:  And then we'll just cover it up

start: 278.59999999999997
end: 280.76
text:  and let it simmer for another 15 minutes.

start: 281.64
end: 283.44
text:  And while we're waiting for this to simmer,

start: 283.44
end: 285.24
text:  give this video a thumbs up.

start: 285.24
end: 286.68
text:  And now I'm gonna make our pasta.

start: 286.68
end: 289.40000000000003
text:  For my pasta, I'm only boiling it for half the time

start: 289.40000000000003
end: 292.36
text:  it says on the box to get rid of the starchiness.

start: 292.36
end: 293.64
text:  Okay, the pasta's boiling.

start: 293.64
end: 295.72
text:  Let's double check on our meat sauce.

start: 297.0
end: 297.84000000000003
text:  Amazing.

start: 297.84000000000003
end: 299.92
text:  I'm gonna give it a quick stir.

start: 299.92
end: 304.6
text:  Oh, yes.

start: 305.28000000000003
end: 307.28000000000003
text:  Honestly, with like the oil on the side,

start: 307.28000000000003
end: 310.88
text:  it looks like I've been simmering this for hours.

start: 310.88
end: 313.52
text:  And you can just see how soft the meat already looks.

start: 315.0
end: 316.32
text:  It's gonna be great.

start: 317.12
end: 319.40000000000003
text:  But now I'm gonna finish cooking off the pasta

start: 319.40000000000003
end: 321.32
text:  inside the meat sauce.

start: 321.32
end: 323.0
text:  I've also saved some pasta water

start: 323.0
end: 325.68
text:  to really help the sauce cling to the pasta.

start: 325.68
end: 328.92
text:  Now the question is, do I mix it with a spoon or a tongs?

start: 328.92
end: 330.24
text:  Because it's gonna be messy.

start: 330.24
end: 331.08
text:  Let's do both.

start: 332.16
end: 335.52
text:  Just make sure that the spaghetti is completely submerged.

start: 335.52
end: 337.12
text:  And then we're gonna let it finish cooking

start: 337.12
end: 339.52
text:  for another five to seven minutes.

start: 339.52
end: 343.36
text:  For me, I love it when my pasta is like fully drenched

start: 343.36
end: 345.56
text:  and flavored in the sauce.

start: 345.56
end: 347.52
text:  And once it's ready, I'm gonna finish it off

start: 347.52
end: 350.4
text:  with some grated Parmesan cheese

start: 350.4
end: 353.12
text:  and some freshly chopped parsley and basil

start: 353.12
end: 354.92
text:  to give it some added freshness.

start: 376.56
end: 377.48
text:  Mm, mm, mm.

start: 378.6
end: 379.84
text:  Let's serve this.

start: 381.16
end: 383.84
text:  Oh, it is drenched in the sauce.

start: 383.84
end: 385.92
text:  And the spaghetti looks perfectly cooked.

start: 390.64
end: 393.6
text:  You can spoon in some more meat sauce right on top.

start: 393.6
end: 394.44
text:  Wow.

start: 395.72
end: 396.72
text:  Look at that.

start: 397.8
end: 400.6
text:  I'll hit it with some more Parmesan cheese,

start: 402.04
end: 403.24
text:  some herbs,

start: 406.08
end: 408.72
text:  and since I like it with a hint of spiciness,

start: 408.72
end: 410.96
text:  some freshly crushed red pepper.

start: 412.32
end: 413.52
text:  Now let's dig in.

start: 415.32
end: 417.92
text:  I was always taught that to have spaghetti,

start: 417.92
end: 421.2
text:  you always twirl it on a spoon like this.

start: 421.2
end: 422.03999999999996
text:  Mm.

start: 433.96
end: 435.52
text:  I'm not even joking when I say

start: 435.52
end: 437.8
text:  that is one of the best spaghetti and meat sauce

start: 437.8
end: 438.68
text:  I've ever had.

start: 438.68
end: 441.4
text:  This is honestly a recipe that I make all the time

start: 441.4
end: 445.44
text:  on my Instagram, and I always get asked for the recipes.
